Programming Assignmentï¼š Draw Tic-Tac-Toe Boards
1. This assignment is very easy; I just followed instructions.

2. When I followed the instructions, almost everything works.

3. When I drew the board, I tried to create a NscRectangle like the last assignment, but decided using NscLine directly
on the NscWindow.

4. I leaned that directly adding lines to the window object can also accomplish the goal. I also really like that idea
of separating the functionality of drawing a line into a method and I think that I would like to use that in my next
assignment.

Fields vs Local variable
The reason NscWindow reference a field but NscLine reference are not, is because NscWindow is a unique object that every
TicTacToeBoard object have to create; while NscLine is not unique and can be expanded if needed.

The reason we are making NscWindow reference private is because of the idea of encapsulation. Making the NscWindow
object public will make it accessible to everyone calling the TicTacToeBoard object.
