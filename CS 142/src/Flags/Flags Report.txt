Programming Assignment: Flag

How did you approach (get started with) this assignment?
    I approached this assignment by identifying the shapes and the background color for each of them.
What works and what doesn't work?
    I do not understand this question.
What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?
    I need to find a way to draw the triangles.
What did you learn from this assignment? What would you do differently next time?
    I learned how to use triangles. I am also more familar with the creating objects. I really do not like the comment being complicated and complex and it is not even standard.

PS:I assume that I do not need to show calculation for each flag in this report since it is already shown in the comment of the 
code. If you think I am missing it, feel free to take points off.
