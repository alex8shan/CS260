Programming Assignmentï¼š Draw Tic-Tac-Toe Boards
1. This assignment is very easy; I just followed instructions.

2. When I followed the instructions, almost everything works.

3. When I drew the board, I tried to create a NscRectangle like the last assignment, but decided using NscLine directly
on the NscWindow.

4. I leaned that directly adding lines to the window object can also accomplish the goal. I also really like that idea
of separating the functionality of drawing a line into a method and I think that I would like to use that in my next
assignment.
